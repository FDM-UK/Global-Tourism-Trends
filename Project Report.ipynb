    "The tourism industry has seen significant growth in recent years, leading to overcrowding in popular destinations. This phenomenon, often referred to as \"overtourism,\" has negative impacts on both the traveller experience and local environments. Our project focuses on helping adventurous female solo travellers who have previously explored guidebook recommendations and now seek authentic, less crowded alternatives."

Initially, we planned to use city-level tourism data, but found only country-level data was consistently available. This required pivoting to a two-step approach: identifying countries with lower tourism rates, then researching specific cities within those countries. Originally, we aimed to find alternatives to popular destinations like Hvar, Bangkok, Rome, Crete, and Dubai. However, as the project progressed, we refined our focus to identify quieter alternatives specifically similar to Greece, to allow for a deeper and more manageable analysis within the project’s timeframe."

    "- Data Granularity Issues: The UNWTO tourism data provided country-level statistics rather than city-specific information, creating challenges for precise recommendations. We addressed this by developing a filtering system that identified promising countries and then researched cities within those countries.\n",
    "- API Rate Limitations: The OpenWeather API's limit of 1000 calls per day constrained our ability to gather comprehensive historical weather data. We strategically prioritized countries based on initial filtering parameters and focused on obtaining the most relevant data points rather than exhaustive coverage. We focused on obtaining the mean temperature and mean rainfall per country.\n",
    "- Weather data precision and accuracy: The OpenWeather API required coordinates to retrieve historical data for each country. A dataset (‘countries.csv’) published by Google was used and merged with the tourism data to provide these coordinates. The coordinates are the geographical center of every country. We obtained these coordinates rather than coordinates for the capital of every country because we anticipated that the solo female traveller may not only stay in the capital. Furthermore, we thought it would improve the validity of the results by ensuring all weather data was based on the centre of every country, thus providing a more representative dataset. We understand that this comes with limitations because the weather across even small countries can vary greatly. \n",
    "- Nested JSON Processing: The SkyScanner API returned deeply nested JSON structures that proved challenging to extract and transform. We developed custom flattening functions to reliably extract the necessary flight data.\n",
    "- Country Name Inconsistencies: Different data sources used varying country name formats (e.g., \"USA\" vs. \"United States\"), complicating data merging. We implemented fuzzy matching algorithms to properly align records across datasets.\n",
    "- Missing Geographical Coordinates: Several countries lacked coordinates in our initial dataset, which were essential for weather data retrieval. Team members manually researched and added these coordinates to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n",
    "- Mobile Formatting Requirements: Creating visualizations that would remain clear and readable on mobile devices presented unique design challenges. We prioritized simplicity and clarity in our chart design, with careful attention to color contrast and text size."

This would have been ideal as it would have improved accuracy of results by accounting for year on year variation. Furthermore, we aimed to retrieve weather data across daylight hours of each day in order to be able to identify the maximum temperature of a day (this data would be most relevant to our traveller). However, collecting data only for 6th June across four years at 12pm used API calls that reached its daily limit. The ‘afternoon’ weather data retrieval (12pm) was chosen because this approximates maximum temperature in most locations. However, we understand that this is an approximation and, in reality, the time of day at which the temperature reaches maximum varies from location to location and as such the 12pm data does not always obtain the maximum temperature.

We suspect this may be due to API-side adjustments or periodic updates to their historic datasets. To ensure consistency and reproducibility across our pipeline, we decided not to re-call the API during final runs. The dataset used (Complete_Weather_Data_For_Destinations.csv - since been renamed) is based on calls made on 17/04/2025 and 18/04/2025, and all downstream processes, including the identification of our top three destinations, are based on that data."
