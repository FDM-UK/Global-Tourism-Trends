# Global Tourism Trends: A Data Science Group Project

## 📌 Project Brief

We were tasked with helping a **hypothetical customer** who enjoys visiting Greece in June but wanted to explore **quieter alternative holiday destinations**.

Our objective was to recommend the top three least-visited countries with:
- **Similar temperatures and rainfall to Greece in June**  
- **Direct flights from Manchester**, considering both **price** and **duration**

To achieve this, we analysed real-world datasets and live API data:
- **United Nations World Tourism Dataset** – to identify quieter destinations  
- **OpenWeather API** – to compare historical weather conditions  
- **Skyscanner Flights API** – to retrieve flight options for June  

This end-to-end workflow included data cleaning, integration, exploratory analysis, and clear communication of insights through both technical reports and a customer-facing presentation.

## 👤 My Contributions

**🔹 Data Preparation & Cleaning**  
- Processed the raw **UNWTO Excel dataset**—merged, cleaned, and reshaped it with `pandas` and `numpy` for seamless integration with weather data.  
- Exported a tidy `.csv` file used by the team for temperature and rainfall filtering.

**🔹 Visualisation Development**  
- Built a **stacked-bar histogram** showing the **Top 10 and Bottom 10 most visited countries**, with visitor counts broken down into **overnight**, **day-trip**, and **cruise** categories.  
- Ensured charts were fully reproducible and well-commented in Jupyter Notebook.

**🔹 Version Control & Workflow**  
- Set up and managed the **GitHub repository**, organised branches, and enforced clear commit messages.  
- Designed and maintained an agile **Trello Kanban board**, assigning tasks and tracking progress across sprints.

**🔹 Design & Reporting**  
- Created graphics for both the technical and customer-facing Jupyter notebooks using Canva.  
- Developed a polished **Canva presentation template**, standardised slide layouts, and embedded multimedia placeholders so teammates could focus solely on content.

## ✨ Project Features

- **Data Integration**: Combined static UN tourism data with live API data (weather & flights).  
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Filtered destinations by climate similarity to Greece in June.  
- **API Retrieval**: Pulled real-time Skyscanner flight options from Manchester.  
- **Custom Visualisations**: Delivered both stacked-bar histograms and comparative charts.  
- **Agile Collaboration**: Managed with Trello and GitHub to ensure smooth team coordination.  
- **Dual Deliverables**: Produced a technical Jupyter Notebook and a customer-friendly notebook plus live presentation.

## ✅ Summary

This group project demonstrates a full data science lifecycle—from raw data acquisition and cleaning to advanced visualisations and customer-focused delivery.  
My role centred on **preparing the UNWTO dataset**, **creating detailed stacked-bar histograms**, **overseeing version control**, and **coordinating agile workflows**, ensuring our team could deliver actionable insights into quieter holiday destinations for June travellers.
